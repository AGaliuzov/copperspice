CopperSpice is a C++ library derived from the Qt framework. Our goal
was to change the core design of the libraries leveraging template
functionality and modern C++11 capabilities.

The redesign allowed us to completely remove the Qt Meta-Object
Compiler (moc) system. Moc is a code generator and did not support
many aspects of C++ including templates, complex data types, static
type checking, and relies heavily on string comparisons. Removing moc
improves run time performance, reduces the complexity of the build
process, and allows more issues to be detected at compile time.

 * New classes, methods, and functionality have been added which
   exceeds what was previously available
 * CopperSpice can be linked directly into any standard C++ application
 * Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc) is fully obsolete
 * A template class can inherit from QObject
 * CopperSpice includes several existing Qt 5 classes
 * The CS libraries can be built using GNU Autotools or CMake
 * CS makes extensive use of C++11 features like variadic templates,
   constexpr, lambdas, atomics, and many others

CopperSpice currently consists of the libraries listed below.

 * CsCore
 * CsGui
 * CsMultimedia
 * CsNetwork
 * CsOpenGL
 * CsPhonon
 * CsScript
 * CsSql
 * CsSvg
 * CsWebKit
 * CsXml
 * CsXmlPatterns
